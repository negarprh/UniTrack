## 🎯 Project Overview

UniTrack simplifies academic management for students.  
It allows users to:
- Plan and organize their **courses** and **weekly class sessions**  
- Track **assignments** and **exams** with automatic reminders

## ✨ Features

### 🗓️ Course & Schedule Management
- Add, edit, or remove **courses** with instructor details and color tags.  
- Add **class sessions** (weekday, start/end time, location).

### ☁️ Cloud Sync (Firestore)
- All Courses, Sessions, Tasks, and StudyLogs stored in **Firebase Firestore**.  
- Organized under each user's UID:  
```

users/{uid}/courses/{courseId}
users/{uid}/sessions/{sessionId}
users/{uid}/tasks/{taskId}
users/{uid}/studyLogs/{logId}

```
- Uses **Firebase Authentication** (email or anonymous) to isolate user data.  
- Data syncs automatically when online.

## 🧩 Architecture

**Pattern:** Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM)

```

SwiftUI Views  →  ViewModels  →  Repositories  →  Firebase Firestore
↘──  NotificationService

````

### Main Components
| Layer | Classes | Responsibility |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Model** | Course, Session, Task, StudyLog | Data structure & logic |
| **ViewModel** | CourseVM, TaskVM, TimerVM, DashboardVM | Handle app logic, connect models with UI |
| **Service** | NotificationService | Schedule and manage reminders |
| **Repository** | FirestoreRepository | CRUD operations with Firebase Firestore |
| **View** | SwiftUI screens | Display and bind data |

---

## 🗃️ Data Model Summary
| Entity | Attributes | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Course** | id, title, instructor, color | Has many sessions and tasks |
| **Session** | id, courseId, weekday, startTime, endTime, location | Belongs to one course |
| **Task** | id, courseId, type[assignment/exam], title, dueDate, isDone, weight | Belongs to one course |
| **StudyLog** | id, courseId, date, minutes | Created by Pomodoro timer |

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **SwiftUI** — Declarative UI framework  
- **MVVM Architecture** — Clean separation of logic  
- **Firebase Firestore** — Real-time NoSQL cloud database  
- **Firebase Authentication** — Optional sign-in system  
- **UNUserNotificationCenter** — Local notifications  
- **Swift Charts** — Optional analytics graph  

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15 or later  
- iOS 17+ simulator or device  
- Active Firebase project

### Setup Steps
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/UniTrack.git

2. Open `UniTrack.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
4. Enable **Firestore Database** and **Authentication (Email/Password or Anonymous)**.
5. Download your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and drag it into the Xcode project (do not commit it to GitHub).
6. Add Firebase via Swift Package Manager:

   ```
   https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
   ```

   Include **FirebaseAuth** and **FirebaseFirestore**.
7. Build and run on a simulator or device.

---

## 🧮 Firestore Structure

```
users
 └── {uid}
      ├── courses
      │    └── {courseId}
      ├── sessions
      │    └── {sessionId}
      ├── tasks
      │    └── {taskId}
      └── studyLogs
           └── {logId}
```

Each user’s data is isolated and secured via Firestore security rules.

---

## 🔒 Firestore Security Rules (Sample)

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
